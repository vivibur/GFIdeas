Grilled peppers can be served as a side dish as you can see in the short ribs plate picture, in sandwiches, and as pizza topping. It is very easy to prepare and is preserved in oil. 


## Ingredients

* 6 Peppers
* oil (we use canola oil, but others work well)
* 6 cloves of chopped garlic (optional)


	


## Preparation

1. You can cook the peppers either in the BBQ or in the oven.  If you use the BBQ preheat to 400-450ÂºF.  If you use the oven use the broil setting.
2. Wash the peppers and place them either in the barbecue or in a baking sheet in the middle rack in the oven.
3. Cook for 10-12 minutes and then turn the peppers every 2-3 minutes, until all sides are charred and the peppers are soft.
4. Remove the peppers from the BBQ or the oven and let them cool down a little, for a few minutes. 
5. Then clean the peppers by removing the skin, the seeds and the stem. Cut them in large pieces  . One pepper may be cut in 2 or 3 slices

6. Chop the garlic in tiny cubes. 
7. In a container with a lid ( a jar or a bowl with a lid) place the peppers, the garlic and add oil until you fully cover the peppers.  We use canola oil but any other oil you like would work. 

Enjoy!
