Breaded cod accompanied by [arugula and mushroom salad]({%post_url 2021-11-18-arugula-mushroom-salad %}) offers a lovely variation to prepare fish. It is delicious, healthy and very easy to prepare. 

## Ingredients
  
* 1 lb of cod fish cut in fillets
* 1 egg
* 2 cups of rice flour or your favorite gluten free flour
* 1 cup of corn starch
* Canola oil (as needed)



## Preparation

1. Cut the fish in rectangles, approximately 2 or 3 inches per side.
2. Create a station of three plates: one with corn starch, one with the egg previously whisked and one with the rice flour mixed with sesame seeds, salt, pepper and chili flakes (optional).
3. Each piece of fish will pass through each of the stations: first cover the fish with corn starch, then with egg and finally pass the fish through the rice flour station.
4. Once all the fish is breaded, heat up oil in a deep wok or pot.
5. To fry the fish, place each piece of fish in the pot with oil until it is golden brown.


Enjoy!!!
