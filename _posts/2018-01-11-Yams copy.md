Yam Chips
Gluten Free, Vegan, Vegetarian, Paleo, No Sugar, Dairy Free, Low Sodium (alternative)


"Ingredients"

1 Yam per person, thinly sliced
Oil
Salt or Pepper

"Preparation"

Step 1.  Preheat the oven at  425ยบ F.  Oil a baking sheet or line it with parchment.
Step 2.  Peel and slice the yam/s very thinly.
Step 3. Arrange the yam slices on the baking sheet side by side. Avoid overlapping them for a faster and even cooking.  
 Then slightly salt the yams and put a few drops of your favorite oil on top.  We like using olive oil, but any oil will work great.  
Step 3.  Place in the oven for 10 minutes.  Then flip the yams in the tray and put them back in the oven for another 10 minutes.  By then the yams should be soft. 
Step 4.  Finally take the yams out of the oven and enjoy!   Serve warm or at room temperature

"Low sodium option"

For the recipe to be low sodium just replace the salt with low sodium salt or pepper.
