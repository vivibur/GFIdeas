A number of recipes need melted chocolate. Below are a few ways you can melt the chocolate.

You can use chocolate in bars or in chips format.  If they are in a bar, first cut it in smaller pieces to allow it to melt easier.

If you would like the mix to be gluten free, make sure you have gluten free chocolate.

If you want the melted chocolate to be dairy free, check your chocolate bar or chocolate chips are dairy free.


1. Using a stove top (or double boiler)

Place the oil, butter or shortening with the chocolate in a bowl.
Place the bowl over a pot of simmering water and whisk the chocolate until all is melted and has a smooth texture. 



2. Using a microwave

Place the oil, butter or shortening with the chocolate in a bowl.
Microwave the mix in microwave for 30 seconds. Remove, stir the chocolate well.
If the chocolate is not melted, repeat the previous step but for 20 seconds.
If the chocolate started to melt, place the bowl in the microwave for 10-15 seconds bursts until fully melted. Each time, remove from the microwave and stir well.


We hope you find them helpful!
