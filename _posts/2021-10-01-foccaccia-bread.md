## What is a focaccia bread and how to eat it?

A focaccia is a flat oven-baked Italian bread. The focaccia is very versatile. You can serve it as a bread to accompany the meal, to make sandwiches, and can be served as a side dish. Sometimes we like using toppings similar to those we use for pizza.


## Ingredients

* 3 cup gluten free flour 
* 2 tsp xhantan gum
* 1 tsp salt
* 3 tsp	sugar
* 4.5 tsp dry yeast
* 3 cup	warm water
* 2 tsp	olive oil
* To taste: coarse salt, rosemary, black olives


## Preparation

1. In a bowl place the gluten free flour with the xhantan gum, salt, sugar and dry yeast.  Add warm water and the olive oil.  Mix with an electric mixer for 2 minutes, until you get an homogeneous dough. Note that it will look runny. 
2. Oil and put some cornstarch on a baking sheet or line the baking sheet with parchment.  Pour the dough on the baking sheet and, if needed, spread the mix with a spatula.  Cover the dough with film, put a cloth on top and let it rise in a warm place until the preparation doubles in size.  It should take 30 minutes to 1 hour. 
4. Preheat the oven to 390ºF.
5. Lightly brush olive oil on the surface of the dough. Sprinkle coarse salt and rosemary to taste. Place the olives on top. 
6. Place the dough in the oven for approximately 25-30 minutes.  The cooking time may vary depending on the baking sheet used. 

 Enjoy!!




## Tips

* To spread the dough on the baking sheet use a wet spatula so that the dough doesn’t stick to it so much.

* If you like the bottom very crusty, place the portions you intend to eat for 3-5 minutes in a pan, at high temperature.

* Other toppings for your focaccia when using it as bread can be garlic instead of olives.

* Rising dough: An easy way to create a good environment for gluten-free  dough to rise is to turn your oven to 100-170ºF, whatever is the minimum your oven allows. When it reaches this temperature, turn off the oven and place the dough in the middle rack of the oven. In 30-40 minutes the dough should be ready, usually at least doubling its size.
