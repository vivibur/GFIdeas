## Ingredients

* 1 brisket
* 2 lb of potatoes
* 4 carrots
* 2 onions
* 1 garlic head
* 5 celery sticks
* 1 cup of red wine (may need up to another cup)
* 1 cup of water (may need up to another cup)
* 6 bay leaves
* 2 cloves
* 1/2 cup Paprika (at least)
* 2 tablespoons olive oil 
* Kosher salt to taste
* Black pepper to taste



## Preparation

1. Remove as much of the extra fat of the brisket as you like. In our case, we like preparing the meat lean.  For this recipe you will only use the lean part. The fat part can be used in other recipes.
2. In a big oven pan place the brisket with some oil and salt.
3. Broil for 10 minutes on each side of the brisket and remove from the oven and take the brisket out of the pan.
4. Turn the oven to 315°F.
5. Prepare the vegetables: clean the potatoes, peel the garlic and Cut the carrots, onions and celery in large pieces.
6. Place all the veggies, clove and bay leaves in the pan with a bit of salt, pepper and oil and mix. 
7. Cover the brisket in paprika on both sides and place the brisket back in the pan on top of the vegetables.
8. Add 1 cup of wine and 1 cup of water. 
9. Cover the pan with aluminum foil and cook for approximately 45 min per pound of brisket. Halfway make sure there’s enough liquid in the pan and also flip the brisket. If the liquid evaporated, add more, always a mix of water and wine in equal parts.
10. To serve, cut the brisket in slices. This can be done when hot or cold.


Enjoy!!!


## Tips

* For the recipe to be low sodium replace the Kosher salt with low sodium salt.

* If you have leftovers you can use the brisket in sandwiches, fried in the pan, or prepare a hash mixing small pieces of the meat, eggs, onions and potatoes.
* The leftover juices can be used as stock or thickened with cornstarch and use it as gluten free gravy.
