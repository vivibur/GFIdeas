## Preparation

1. Preheat the oven to 325°F.
2. Grease a baking pan with oil or cover with parchment.
3. Melt the unsweetened chocolate with the oil or butter. Place the oil, butter or shortening with the chocolate in a bowl. Place the bowl over a pot of simmering water and whisk the chocolate until all is melted and has a smooth texture.
Alternatively, you can also melt the chocolate in the microwave. See the post with tips on how to melt [chocolate]({% post_url 2021-10-15-melt-chocolate %}). 
4. In a mixer, first beat the eggs and honey.  Then, add the coconut flour, the cocoa powder, vanilla, baking soda and salt and beat on low until all ingredients are integrated. Then you can beat on high until you have a smooth mix.
5. Add the melted chocolate until the mix thickens, around 15-20 seconds. Add the chocolate chips and stir them in the mix.
6. Pour the batter in the greased pan or pan with parchment. Smooth the top with the spatula or the back of a spoon. Add the walnuts on top.
7. Bake for 35-45 minutes. To see if it is ready, put a toothpick in the center of the cake. If it comes out clean it is ready. Remove and let it cool for 15 minutes.


Enjoy!!
