For our recipes you can use any gluten free flour.  Personally, I always keep in my pantry a mix of flours that I like for baking. This is another combination of products I like using.

## Ingredients

* 300 grams of rice flour
* 300 grams of tapioca starch 
* 400 grams of cornstarch

Keep it in an air-tight container.
Note: make sure that all your ingredients are gluten-free.
