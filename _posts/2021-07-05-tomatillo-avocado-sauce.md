This is a very simple recipe to prepare a tasty sauce that goes well with meats, fish, in sandwiches, tacos and burritos.

## Ingredients

* 4 medium size tomatillos 
* 1 tbsp cilantro, chopped
* 1 handful of fresh cilantro 
* 1 head of garlic
* 2 jalapeños (optional, if you like it spicy)
* 1 tbsp lime juice
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/2 avocado (ripe)


## Preparation

1. Wash the tomatillos.
2. Cut the top of the garlic head.
3. If cooked in the BBQ, preheat to high temperature. Place the tomatillos, the garlic and the jalapeños in the BBQ for 2 minutes on each side.  
4. If cooked in the oven, turn on the broiler. Place the tomatillos, the garlic and the jalapeños on a baking sheet in the middle rack for 3 minutes on each side.
5. The tomatillos are ready when charred on both sides, but do not let them get too soft. The garlic is ready when soft, when you can poke with the knife with no resistance. Finally, with the jalapeños it doesn’t matter if it is soft or not.  
6. Let the tomatillos, garlic and the jalapeños cool down.
7. In a blender place the tomatillos, jalapeños, 1/4 avocado, 4 cloves of garlic (or more, to taste), salt, 1 handful of cilantro, lime juice and blend.
8. Place the mix in a bowl, add 1/4 avocado diced, the chopped cilantro, additional lime juice and salt to taste.  


Enjoy!!!
