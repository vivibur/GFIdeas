Chicken skewers make such a wonderful main dish. They are so easy to prepare and look so nice either for yourself or when organizing gatherings!


## Ingredients

* 1 pound of boneless chicken thighs
* 2 onions (have one more ready just in case)
* 2 peppers (have one more ready just in case)
* 10 white mushrooms 
* Metal or wood skewers
* Kosher salt (to taste)
* Black pepper (to taste)
* Paprika (to taste)
* Chili flakes (optional, to taste)
* 2 tablespoons olive oil 



## Preparation

1. Clean the chicken thighs by removing extra fat and tendons. Cut the chicken in 1 inch cubes (approximately)
2. Cut the onions and the peppers in one inch cubes
3. Cut the mushrooms in quarters
4. If the skewers are made of wood, make sure the skewers have been in cold water for at least 10 minutes
5. Once the skewers are ingredients are cut, using one skewer at a time start “stabbing” a bit of onion with the pointy end and move it down the skewer to become the bottom piece (close to your hand). Keep adding pieces of chicken, pepper, onion and mushroom until being an inch from the top. Close the skewers with another bit of onion (smaller pieces could work well).
6. Sprinkle some salt, pepper, paprika and chili flakes (optional) over the skewers. Brush the skewers with the olive oil.
7. Cooking in the BBQ: Preheat the BBQ and place the skewers turning them every 8 min or so until the chicken is well cooked from all sides. Bigger cubes of food may take more time to cook, smaller pieces less.
8. Cooking in the oven: Preheat the oven to 425°F and follow the same instructions as above.


Enjoy!!!
