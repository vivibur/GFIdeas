Over the years we were collecting some useful tips when preparing gluten free pizza.  We hope you find them helpful! 



## Tip 1. How to get gluten-free pizza dough to rise

An easy way to create a good environment for gluten-free pizza dough to rise is to turn your oven to 100-170ºF, whatever is the minimum your oven allows.  When it reaches this temperature, turn off the oven and place the pizza dough in the middle rack of the oven.  In 30-40 minutes the pizza dough should be ready, usually at least doubling its size.



## Tip 2. Pizza toppings

Using many toppings is sometimes tricky with gluten-free dough. 

What works best for us when using lots of toppings is to prepare the pizza in the oven with only tomato or tomato and cheese. Separately prepare the different toppings and add them on top once the pizza is done.  


## Tip 3. Crispy gluten-free pizza

If you like your pizza crispier, especially in the bottom, after the pizza is cooked place the pizza or the portions you are planning to have on a pan for 3-5 minutes at high temperature.


## Tip 4. Melting Cheese
For the cheese to melt better, either slice or shred it and place it in a bowl with water for at least 15 minutes.

When you need to use the cheese on your pizza, just strain the water and put the cheese on your pizza. The cheese will melt beautifully!!


## Tip 5. Warm-up cold pizza in the microwave

If you plan to warm up your pizza in the microwave, place a paper towel or paper napkin in the bottom of the plate.  That way the paper will absorb the humidity and the pizza won’t get soggy.
