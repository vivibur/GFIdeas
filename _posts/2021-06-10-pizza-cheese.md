* 2 tsp	olive oil
* 6 tbsp tomato sauce
* 2 cups cheese such as mozzarella or havarti (any cheese that melts)
* Oregano to taste 	
* Olives, green and/or black to taste 	

## Preparation

1. In a bowl place the gluten free flour with the xhantan gum, salt, sugar and dry yeast. Make a small hole in the center and add the warm water and the olive oil. Mix with an electric mixer for 2 minutes, until you get a homogeneous and creamy dough.

2. Oil a pizza baking sheet or line it with parchment. Pour the dough on the baking sheet, spread the mix with a spatula or with your hands to give it a round shape. (Tip: to mold the pizza wet the spatula or your hands with cold water).  

3. Cover the dough with film, put a clean cloth on top and let it rise in a warm place until the preparation doubles in size. It should take 30 minutes to 1 hour. 
4. Preheat the oven to 390ºF and place the baking sheet in the bottom of the oven for 15 minutes approximately, until the bottom of the pizza can be easily raised with a spatula. 
5. Take the pizza out of the oven, spread the tomato sauce on the pizza dough and distribute the cheese either cut in slices or shredded on top. We like using mozzarella and havarti.
6. Place the pizza back in the oven, in the middle rack, for 10 minutes approximately, until the cheese if fully melted.  
7. If you like the cheese crispy, change the oven to broiler for 3-5 minutes, until the cheese is bubbling. This step is optional.
8. Take the pizza out of the oven, put olives on top and sprinkle oregano. Enjoy!!!


## Tips

* The original recipe is lacto-vegetarian.  To make the recipe vegan just replace the cheese with a vegan cheese alternative that melts on top.

* How to warm up pizza:  ideally don’t use microwave, but if you do, put paper towel under the pizza.
