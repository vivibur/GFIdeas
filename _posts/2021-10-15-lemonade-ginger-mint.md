This is an ideal summer beverage, delicious and refreshing. 
I will present a couple of options to prepare it, as a smoothie or as a  juice.


## Ingredients

* 5 mint branches
* 2 lemons 
* 5 slices ginger
* 2 cups ice cubes
* 2 cups cold water
* Sugar, honey or low calorie replacement to taste.



## Preparation

## Smoothy

1. In a blender add water, ginger, some mint leaves, the sugar (or honey or low calorie sweetener in a blender). Place the lemons peeled and cut in smaller pieces and finally the ice on top.
2. Blend until you obtain a relatively smooth beverage.  I personally prefer the beverage to have some texture, with more visible ice. Others in the family prefer it smoother, with the ice crushed more.
3. Place in a pitcher and serve.

## Juice

1. Wash the lemons and cut them in thin slices.
2. Separate the mint leaves. 
3. In a pitcher add all the ingredients: lemon, ginger, mint leaves, sugar (or alternative), ice and water. Mix well and serve.


Enjoy!!
