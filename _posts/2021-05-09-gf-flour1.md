For our recipes you can use any gluten free flour.  Personally, I always keep in my pantry a mix of flours that I like for baking. 

## Ingredients

* 3 cups of rice flour
* 1 cups of cornstarch
* 1/2 cup fo tapioca starch

Keep it in an air-tight container.
Note: make sure that all your ingredients are gluten-free.
