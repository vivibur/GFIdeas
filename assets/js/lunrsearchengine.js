Drain the chickpeas, place them in a pot, cover them with water and cook them until they are soft. Let them cool and don’t forget to keep the water used to cook the garbanzo beans.

    "body": "2021/10/01 - What is a focaccia bread and how to eat it?: A focaccia is a flat oven-baked Italian bread. The focaccia is very versatile. You can serve it as a bread to accompany the meal, to make sandwiches, and can be served as a side dish. Sometimes we like using toppings similar to those we use for pizza. Ingredients:  3 cup gluten free flour 2 tsp xhantan gum 1 tsp salt 3 tsp	sugar 4. 5 tsp dry yeast 3 cup	warm water 2 tsp	olive oil To taste: coarse salt, rosemary, black olivesPreparation:  In a bowl place the gluten free flour with the xhantan gum, salt, sugar and dry yeast.  Add warm water and the olive oil.  Mix with an electric mixer for 2 minutes, until you get an homogeneous dough. Note that it will look runny.  Oil and put some cornstarch on a baking sheet or line the baking sheet with parchment.  Pour the dough on the baking sheet and, if needed, spread the mix with a spatula.  Cover the dough with film, put a cloth on top and let it rise in a warm place until the preparation doubles in size.  It should take 30 minutes to 1 hour.  Preheat the oven to 390ºF.  Lightly brush olive oil on the surface of the dough. Sprinkle coarse salt and rosemary to taste. Place the olives on top.  Place the dough in the oven for approximately 25-30 minutes.  The cooking time may vary depending on the baking sheet used. Enjoy!! Tips:    To spread the dough on the baking sheet use a wet spatula so that the dough doesn’t stick to it so much.     If you like the bottom very crusty, place the portions you intend to eat for 3-5 minutes in a pan, at high temperature.     Other toppings for your focaccia when using it as bread can be garlic instead of olives.     Rising dough: An easy way to create a good environment for gluten-free dough to rise is to turn your oven to 100-170ºF, whatever is the minimum your oven allows. When it reaches this temperature, turn off the oven and place the dough in the middle rack of the oven. In 30-40 minutes the dough should be ready, usually at least doubling its size.  "

    "body": "2021/06/17 - Over the years we were collecting some useful tips when preparing gluten free pizza.  We hope you find them helpful! Tip 1. How to get gluten-free pizza dough to rise: An easy way to create a good environment for gluten-free pizza dough to rise is to turn your oven to 100-170ºF, whatever is the minimum your oven allows.  When it reaches this temperature, turn off the oven and place the pizza dough in the middle rack of the oven.  In 30-40 minutes the pizza dough should be ready, usually at least doubling its size. Tip 2. Pizza toppings: Using many toppings is sometimes tricky with gluten-free dough. What works best for us when using lots of toppings is to prepare the pizza in the oven with only tomato or tomato and cheese. Separately prepare the different toppings and add them on top once the pizza is done. Tip 3. Crispy gluten-free pizza: If you like your pizza crispier, especially in the bottom, after the pizza is cooked place the pizza or the portions you are planning to have on a pan for 3-5 minutes at high temperature. Tip 4. Melting Cheese: For the cheese to melt better, either slice or shred it and place it in a bowl with water for at least 15 minutes. When you need to use the cheese on your pizza, just strain the water and put the cheese on your pizza. The cheese will melt beautifully!! Tip 5. Warm-up cold pizza in the microwave: If you plan to warm up your pizza in the microwave, place a paper towel or paper napkin in the bottom of the plate.  That way the paper will absorb the humidity and the pizza won’t get soggy. "

If you like the cheese crispy, change the oven to broiler for 3-5 minutes, until the cheese is bubbling. This step is optional.
